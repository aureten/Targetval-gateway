AUTOGENERATED ROUTER (rich spec) — 55 modules, LIVE public sources only.

This file is intentionally verbose (~1.5 MB) to serve as the single source of truth
for your domain→module matrix, normalized schemas, and explicit FastAPI routes.
It includes comprehensive docstrings, adapter stubs, and examples so engineers
can wire LIVE clients without guesswork.

A) Domain ↔ Module coverage
Domains:
1 = Human causality & target validation
2 = Target & disease biology
3 = Target selectivity & expression
4 = Druggability
5 = Therapeutic index & safety
6 = Clinical translation

Marks: P = primary signal, S = secondary

'''DEVELOPER_REFERENCE_START
This section serves as an implementation guide embedded alongside the router.
It is intentionally verbose to remove ambiguity for engineers wiring LIVE clients and synthesis.

### Module 1: expr-baseline
Path: /expr/baseline
Domains → primary=[3] secondary=[2, 5]
LIVE sources: GTEx API, EBI Expression Atlas API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).
  [Normalization #001] IDs: enforce casing and map synonyms → canonical IDs; keep the original token in qualifiers.original where present.
  [Validation #002] Anchors: require ≥1 of gene|target|disease|trait|drug|variant; reject unscoped queries to avoid non-deterministic payloads.
  [Context #003] Tissue/Cell: prefer UBERON/CL ids; when labels are passed, record label and id after ontology lookup.
  [Provenance #004] Each record must store source, optional native id, retrieval time, and a deterministic query hash for auditability.
  [Metrics #005] Capture effect sizes, uncertainty, and method tags where available; keep units explicit and consistent.
  [Semantics #006] Do not merge heterogeneous evidence types into single numbers; keep edges typed (e.g., l2g_causal, diff_expr, binds_MHC).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 2: expr-localization
Path: /expr/localization
Domains → primary=[3, 4] secondary=[5]
LIVE sources: UniProtKB API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 3: expr-inducibility
Path: /expr/inducibility
Domains → primary=[3] secondary=[2, 5]
LIVE sources: EBI Expression Atlas API, NCBI GEO E-utilities, ArrayExpress/BioStudies API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 6: assoc-spatial
Path: /assoc/spatial
Domains → primary=[3] secondary=[2, 5]
LIVE sources: Europe PMC API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 7: sc-hubmap
Path: /sc/hubmap
Domains → primary=[3] secondary=[2]
LIVE sources: HuBMAP Search API, HCA Azul APIs
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 8: assoc-proteomics
Path: /assoc/proteomics
Domains → primary=[2] secondary=[1, 5, 6]
LIVE sources: ProteomicsDB API, PRIDE Archive API, PDC (CPTAC) GraphQL
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 9: assoc-metabolomics
Path: /assoc/metabolomics
Domains → primary=[2] secondary=[1, 6]
LIVE sources: MetaboLights API, Metabolomics Workbench API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 11: assoc-perturb
Path: /assoc/perturb
Domains → primary=[2] secondary=[4]
LIVE sources: LINCS LDP APIs, CLUE.io API, PubChem PUG-REST
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 12: genetics-l2g
Path: /genetics/l2g
Domains → primary=[1] secondary=[6]
LIVE sources: OpenTargets GraphQL (L2G), GWAS Catalog REST API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 13: genetics-coloc
Path: /genetics/coloc
Domains → primary=[1] secondary=[2]
LIVE sources: OpenTargets GraphQL (colocalisations), eQTL Catalogue API, OpenGWAS API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 14: genetics-mr
Path: /genetics/mr
Domains → primary=[1] secondary=[]
LIVE sources: IEU OpenGWAS API, PhenoScanner v2 API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.

### Module 15: genetics-rare
Path: /genetics/rare
Domains → primary=[1] secondary=[5]
LIVE sources: ClinVar via NCBI E-utilities, MyVariant.info, Ensembl VEP REST
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 17: genetics-phewas-human-knockout
Path: /genetics/phewas-human-knockout
Domains → primary=[1] secondary=[5]
LIVE sources: PhenoScanner v2 API, OpenGWAS PheWAS, HPO/Monarch APIs
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 18: genetics-sqtl
Path: /genetics/sqtl
Domains → primary=[1, 3] secondary=[]
LIVE sources: GTEx sQTL API, eQTL Catalogue API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 19: genetics-pqtl
Path: /genetics/pqtl
Domains → primary=[1, 3] secondary=[]
LIVE sources: OpenTargets GraphQL (pQTL colocs), OpenGWAS (protein traits, when available)
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 22: genetics-regulatory
Path: /genetics/regulatory
Domains → primary=[1] secondary=[2, 3]
LIVE sources: ENCODE REST API, eQTL Catalogue API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 23: genetics-annotation
Path: /genetics/annotation
Domains → primary=[1] secondary=[5]
LIVE sources: Ensembl VEP REST, MyVariant.info, CADD API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 24: genetics-consortia-summary
Path: /genetics/consortia-summary
Domains → primary=[1] secondary=[6]
LIVE sources: IEU OpenGWAS API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 25: genetics-functional
Path: /genetics/functional
Domains → primary=[1] secondary=[2]
LIVE sources: DepMap API, BioGRID ORCS REST, Europe PMC API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 28: genetics-mirna
Path: /genetics/mirna
Domains → primary=[2] secondary=[1]
LIVE sources: RNAcentral API, Europe PMC API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 29: genetics-pathogenicity-priors
Path: /genetics/pathogenicity-priors
Domains → primary=[1] secondary=[5]
LIVE sources: gnomAD GraphQL API, CADD API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 30: genetics-intolerance
Path: /genetics/intolerance
Domains → primary=[1] secondary=[5]
LIVE sources: gnomAD GraphQL API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 33: mech-pathways
Path: /mech/pathways
Domains → primary=[2] secondary=[5]
LIVE sources: Reactome Content/Analysis APIs, Pathway Commons API, SIGNOR API, QuickGO API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 34: mech-ligrec
Path: /mech/ligrec
Domains → primary=[2, 4] secondary=[3]
LIVE sources: OmniPath (ligand–receptor), IUPHAR/Guide to Pharmacology API, Reactome interactors
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 35: biology-causal-pathways
Path: /biology/causal-pathways
Domains → primary=[2] secondary=[5]
LIVE sources: SIGNOR API, Reactome Analysis Service, Pathway Commons API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 36: tract-drugs
Path: /tract/drugs
Domains → primary=[4, 6] secondary=[1]
LIVE sources: ChEMBL API, DGIdb GraphQL, DrugCentral API, BindingDB API, PubChem PUG-REST, STITCH API, Pharos GraphQL
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 37: tract-ligandability-sm
Path: /tract/ligandability-sm
Domains → primary=[4] secondary=[2]
LIVE sources: UniProtKB API, AlphaFold DB API, PDBe API, PDBe-KB API, BindingDB API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Path: /tract/ligandability-ab
Domains → primary=[4, 3] secondary=[5]
LIVE sources: UniProtKB API, GlyGen API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 39: tract-ligandability-oligo
Path: /tract/ligandability-oligo
Domains → primary=[4] secondary=[2]
LIVE sources: Ensembl VEP REST, RNAcentral API, Europe PMC API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 40: tract-modality
Path: /tract/modality
Domains → primary=[4] secondary=[6]
LIVE sources: UniProtKB API, AlphaFold DB API, Pharos GraphQL, IUPHAR/Guide to Pharmacology API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 41: tract-immunogenicity
Path: /tract/immunogenicity
Domains → primary=[5] secondary=[4]
LIVE sources: IEDB IQ-API, IPD-IMGT/HLA API, Europe PMC API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 44: tract-surfaceome
Path: /tract/surfaceome
Domains → primary=[4, 3] secondary=[6]
LIVE sources: UniProtKB API, GlyGen API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 45: function-dependency
Path: /function/dependency
Domains → primary=[5] secondary=[2, 3]
LIVE sources: DepMap API, BioGRID ORCS REST
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 46: immuno-hla-coverage
Path: /immuno/hla-coverage
Domains → primary=[5] secondary=[6]
LIVE sources: IEDB population coverage/Tools API, IPD-IMGT/HLA API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 47: clin-endpoints
Path: /clin/endpoints
Domains → primary=[6] secondary=[1]
LIVE sources: ClinicalTrials.gov v2 API, WHO ICTRP web service
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.

  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 50: clin-safety
Path: /clin/safety
Domains → primary=[5] secondary=[]
LIVE sources: openFDA FAERS API, DrugCentral API, CTDbase API, DGIdb GraphQL, IMPC API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 51: clin-rwe
Path: /clin/rwe
Domains → primary=[5] secondary=[]
LIVE sources: openFDA FAERS API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 52: clin-on-target-ae-prior
Path: /clin/on-target-ae-prior
Domains → primary=[5] secondary=[3]
LIVE sources: DrugCentral API, DGIdb GraphQL, openFDA FAERS API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

### Module 55: comp-freedom
Path: /comp/freedom
Domains → primary=[6] secondary=[]
LIVE sources: PatentsView API
Purpose & Scope:
  - This module contributes domain-level signals while remaining source-of-truth aligned to LIVE programmatic feeds.
  - Inputs must be normalized to canonical ontologies (HGNC/UniProt, EFO/MONDO, UBERON/CL) before synthesis.
  - Output is a normalized record set designed for downstream causal/graph algorithms (no grading exposed).

Edge Cases & Interop Notes:
  - Paging: upstream APIs differ (page/size vs. offset/limit); adapters standardize on limit/offset.
  - Sorting: unsupported sort keys must be ignored silently; prefer deterministic default order.
  - Time windows: if upstream lacks dates, ignore from_date/to_date rather than fabricating filters.
  - Species: default human; non-human only if source explicitly supports it and the query requests it.
  - Rate limits: consult per-adapter policies; backoff + retry with jitter; never hammer public endpoints.
  - Reproducibility: store query params and normalized environment (client version) with every response.

# NOTE to maintainers:
# - This block only APPENDS code. It does not alter or remove any
#   existing classes, routes, or registries defined above.
# - We implement concrete SourceClient subclasses and register them
#   in SOURCE_CLIENTS using the exact strings present in ModuleSpec.live_sources.
# - A light-weight async HTTP engine with retries/backoff/timeout is provided.
# - If a given upstream is unreachable, we surface the error in the per-source
